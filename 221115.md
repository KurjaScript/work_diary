  In my most recent role, a former coworker left her job unexpectedly. During this time, she was the team leader on an important new project. When she left, my manager asked me to take it over. While I had never performed her job duties in the past, I had previous leadership experience. Using my leadership and problem-solving skills, I pushed the project forward, encouraged the rest of the team and completed her responsibilities as well as mine. We were able to complete this project successfully and on deadline.
  在我最近的工作中，一位前同事意外辞职。在此期间，她是一个重要的新项目的团队领导。她离开后，我的经理让我接手。虽然我过去从未履行过她的工作职责，但我有过领导经验。利用我的领导力和解决问题的能力，我推动了项目向前发展，鼓励了团队的其他成员，完成了她和我的职责。我们成功地在最后期限前完成了这个项目。

  I want to never feel like I've given less than my best.
  我从不愿意留下没有尽全力的遗憾。
  
  I believe that's the key to reaching all my goals in my career because I know that I have the ability and training. If I'm committed and driven, which I am, then I will succeed, I will be given ever more responsibility and, ultimately, I believe I will work my way into the top positions.
  那是我实现职业目标的关键，因为我知道我有足够的能力并且训练有素。假如我尽职尽责，奋发努力，就像现在这样，我必定能成功过。进而我会被委以重任，最后进入到高层职责。
  
  In doing so, I will lay the foundation for the other parts of my life-family and contributions to my community. I want to be a well-rounded person, but it starts with the highest degree of commitment in my chosen field.
  在做这些事的过程中，我也为人生其他方面，也就是家庭和对社会的贡献，打好基础。我想成为一个在各方面都有所发展的人，但是这必须从对我选择的领域做出最大的贡献开始。
